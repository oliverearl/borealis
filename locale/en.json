The magnetometer takes hundreds of readings each day, so this tool provides an average for both value and temperature from that day to compensate for such a large set of data. Dramatic shifts in magnetosphere strength or temperature of the device caused by solar event, harsh weather, or otherwise should nevertheless still be reflected within the data.",
